And SVM gets the highest F1 Score on test set, which means it's good on generalization.  Besides, the data usage by SVM is also small, which only feed a training set size of 100 to reach a good model.  \n",

    "**Answer: **An example of using SVM in classifying: Suppose some given data points each belong to one of two classes, and the goal is to decide which class a new data point will be in. In the case of support vector machines, a data point is viewed as a p-dimensional vector (a list of p numbers), and we want to know whether we can separate such points with a (p-1)-dimensional hyperplane. This is called a linear classifier.  There are many hyperplanes that might classify the data. One reasonable choice as the best hyperplane is the one that represents the largest margin between the two classes. So when we have new points to predict, the largest margin can reduce error if the new point is near the margin hard to be classified. \n",
    "\n",
    "The training processing is simple, giving a set of data and trying to find the hyperplane so that the distance from it to the nearest data point on each side is maximized. And the predict process is to project the new data point into our p-dimensional space, and distinguish which sub-space separated by hyperplanes the point belongs to. The SVM can also apply to non-linear data. By using kernel trick, in another word, applying nonlinear kernel function instead of original dot product can transform original feature space into high dimensional one.  Although the classifier is a hyperplane in the transformed feature space, it may be nonlinear in the original input space. That's how SVM applying to nonlinear data.\n"
