## MLND-Project

Hello and welcome! 

This repo contains all the codes and report I wrote during my Udacity Machine Learning Nano-degree.
And please look at the .ipynb files, they are the core codes and results. 


###Here is the brief of all projects:


###P1: Predicting Boston Housing Prices
By using Boston Housing dataset, and Decision Tree model from sklearn, to build a linear supervised machine learning model, which can predict the price of a house based on given features.


###P2: Build a Student Intervention System
I tried three major classifiers in this project: Decision Tree, SVM and KNeighborsClassifier. In order to learn how to evaluate and tune models by metrics like f1_score.


###P3: Creating Customer Segments
To learn unsupervised learning methods like PCA and clustering by K-Means model and GMM model. Trying to understand how to choose a number of clusters' number and the dimension number of PCA.


###P4: Train a Smartcab to Drive
To learn how the reinforcement learning work. an intelligent car learns to avoid crashing and obeys traffic lights gradually through an instant punishment and long-term reward based on a real-time updated table of weights of situation-action pairs.
This project is built from scrath and sorry for no images, but you can download the code and try out. 


###P5: Capstone Project: House Number Digits Recognization 
The purpose of capstone project is to utilize the learned knowledge. And I choose to use Tensorflow to built a CNN to do some computer vision job. 
By using The Street View House Numbers Dataset, a convolutional neural network has been built. I also trying out many advanced method like Inception Model from GoogLeNet and AdagradOptimizer, the tuned model performs pretty good. The structure of the model contains totoally six convolutional layers, you can see my .pdf for an image of structure. 
However, I don't have a GPU to tune a more deeper model. I'm trying on implement a GPU version on AWS now.


###PS. According to the Honor of Code, my code is just for reference here. Is there anything I shouldn't publicize, please connect me through zhr.here@gmail.com
